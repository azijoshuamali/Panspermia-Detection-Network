# Decentralized Autonomous Panspermia Detection Network (DPDN)

## Overview

The Decentralized Autonomous Panspermia Detection Network (DPDN) is an open-source platform that coordinates global efforts to detect and analyze potential evidence of panspermia - the hypothesis that life exists throughout the Universe and is distributed by celestial objects like meteoroids, asteroids, and comets.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Collection Network
- Integration with space telescopes and astronomical observatories
- Automated probe data ingestion system
- Standardized data formatting and validation
- Real-time data streaming infrastructure

### 2. Smart Contract Architecture

#### Observation Management Contract
- Validates and stores observation metadata
- Manages access control and data integrity
- Coordinates peer review process
- Implements data quality assurance protocols

#### Analysis Task Contract
- Distributes analysis assignments
- Tracks task completion status
- Manages computational resource allocation
- Handles result verification

#### Token Economics
- PANS utility token for network participation
- Rewards distribution for quality data submissions
- Staking mechanisms for validator nodes
- Penalty system for malicious behavior

### 3. NFT Framework
- Unique identifiers for potential biosignatures
- Metadata structure for specimen characteristics
- Chain of custody tracking
- Verification of discovery claims

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Infrastructure
- Ethereum/Polygon blockchain network
- IPFS for distributed data storage
- GraphQL API for data queries
- WebAssembly for complex computations

### Client Requirements
- Web3-enabled browser
- Minimum 16GB RAM for analysis nodes
- GPU support for image processing
- 100GB+ storage for full node operators

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/dpdn.git
cd dpdn
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure your environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings
```

4. Start the local development network:
```bash
npm run network
```

## Contributing

### Data Providers
1. Register as a data provider
2. Configure your observation equipment
